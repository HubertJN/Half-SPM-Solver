# Miscellaneous Code

## Python

### plots.py

plots.py reads the data from the NetCDF output file generated from the main program and creates three plots: a concentration profile across particle radius over time; a contour plot of concentration across the single particle over time and if a voltage calculation was performed it also displays the voltage over time.

### generate_inp_params.py

generate_inp_params.py reads the input file that has been generated by Input_NetCDF.ipynb and attempts to extract standard deviation values and a number of samples to perform latin hyper cube sampling, after succesfully importing standard deviations it produces a normal distribution with the initial input value as the mean. If reading standard deviation fails then the standard deviations are set to zero and the code continues. Then the code generates random numbers between 0 and 1 using random latin hyper sampling for the number of variables with standard deviation greater than 0. It then maps these onto the gaussian distributions. Then it puts all the samples into an array and saves them to a .csv file. These will act as the inputs for the random sampling code. See "make_input_file.py" and "vis_up_data.py".

### generate_inp_params_sens.py

generate_inp_params_sens.py reads the input file that has been generated by Input_NetCDF.ipynb. It then purterbs the parameters by \f$ 10^{-4}% \f$ and saves these to a 10 by 9 array where the first row is the initial input parameters and the others are the initial input parameters with the diaganal perturbed by \f$ 10^{-4}% \f$. The it saves the array to a .csv file. These will act as the inputs for the sensitivity analysis code. See "make_input_file.py" and "vis_uq_res.py".

### make_input_file.py

make_input_file.py read the .csv file by generate_inp_params.py and generate_inp_params_sens.py and creates a NetCDF input file that can be read by the program.

### vis_uq_res.py

vis_uq_res.py reads in the original parameters from the input file and regenerates the 9 x 10 array created in generate_inp_params_sens.py. Then extracts the voltage data that was created by running the main program with the perturbed parameters and calculates first derivative of the voltage with respect to the parameters. Then calculates the scaled first order sensitivities and saves this data to a .csv file. Then it plots an animation of these scaled first order sensitivities over time.

### visual_up_data.py

visual_up_data.py extracts the voltage data calculated from the random latin hyper cube input samples and calculates the 97.5<sub>th</sub> percentile and the 2.5<sub>th</sub> percentile. It plots this data along side the mean voltage extracted from the original output file.

### vis_uncer_sens.py

vis_uncer_sens.py extracts the standard deviations of the voltage at each time step created by generate_inp_params.py and plots the data along with the mean voltage from the original output file.
